    Q                   = txn matrix reporting the discharge for each timestep
    external_input      = txnxn_c matrix. Per each reach and per each timestep is defined an external sediment input of a certain sediment class
    Qbi_dep_in          = sediment material volume available in reaches at the beginning of the simulation
                        (it could be that for the same reach id, there are two strata defined so two rows of the dataframe with the top row is the deepest strata)

    update_slope        = bool to chose if we change slope trought time or not. If Flase, constant slope. If True, slope changes according to sediment deposit.
    eros_max            = maximum erosion depth per time step [m], is equal to the active layer depth by default
    save_dep_layer      = saving option of the deposit layer for each time step
    ts_length           = the length in seconds of the timestep (60*60*24 for daily timesteps)

    indx_tr_cap         = the index indicating the transport capacity formula
    indx_tr_partition   = the index indicating the type of sediment flux partitioning
    indx_flo_depth      = the index indicating the flow depth formula, default 1 is Manning



    OPTIONAL:
    indx_velocity       = the index indicating the method for calculating velocity (see compute_cascades_velocities)
    indx_vel_partition  = the index indicating the type of partitioning in the section used to compute velocity
    indx_slope_red      = the index indicating the slope reduction formula, default 1 is no reduction
