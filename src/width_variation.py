Functions for variying the width per time step and reach, as a function of, for example:
    - reach hypsometry (water level, discharge)
    - trend with time ..etc

The formula by Lugo (2015) is developped on flume experiments and link the insteantaneous
    active width to the water width. Here we use it as it is used in Bizzi (2021),
    to link the water width to the bankfull width (yearly active width).
