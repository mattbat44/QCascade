    @brief Computes the grain size corresponding to a given cumulative percentage (DXX)
           for a reach with a specified grain size distribution.

    @param fi_r Array of fractions of material in each grain size class for one reach (1D)
                or for all reaches (2D).
                For example, [0.15, 0.50, 0.35] represents 15%, 50%, and 35% of material
                in three grain size classes.
    @param d_value The target DXX value (e.g., 50 for D50, 90 for D90) representing the
                   grain size for which X% of the material is finer.
    @param psi Array of grain sizes in negative log base-2 scale. For example,
               `-3` represents 2³ = 8 mm, `-4` represents 2⁴ = 16 mm.

    @return Array of computed grain sizes (in meters) corresponding to the requested DXX
            for each input layer. If only one grain size class is present, the function
            returns that grain size. If `d_value` equals 100, it returns the smallest
            grain size.

    @details
    - The function supports both single-layer (`fi_r` as a vector) and multi-layer (`fi_r`
      as a matrix) inputs. For multi-layer cases, it processes each layer independently.
    - The function assumes that the provided grain sizes in `psi` are the maximum sizes
      of each class and not average sizes.

    @note The grain size distribution is interpolated in logarithmic (base-2) space,
          as is standard in sedimentology, and converted back to linear scale in meters.

    @example
    ```
    fi_r = [0.15, 0.50, 0.35]
    d_value = 50
    psi = [-3, -4, -5]
    result = D_finder(fi_r, d_value, psi)
    ```
